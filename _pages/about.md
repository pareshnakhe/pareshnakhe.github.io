This blog is an outlet for almost anything I find interesting enough to write about. Mostly, that is about machine learning algorithms, general topics in data science and software engineering. At work, I develop ML solutions, engineer data products and make data tell stories (with the backdrop of beautiful plots of course!). Every so often, I come across things I find elegant, beautiful or just plain old useful. My intention is to use this blog to document and share these small and big wonderful things.
