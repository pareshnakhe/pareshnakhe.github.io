This blog is an outlet for my general machine learning / data science thoughts.

I am currently working as a data scientist at Smart Pricer GmbH. My interests
include among other things sequential machine learning, revenue optimizing
pricing algorithms and more recently Bayesian modeling.

I find myself often flirting with Tensor flow framework, and hope to write
something on that as well.
