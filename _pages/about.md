This blog is an outlet for my machine learning, data science and for that matter anything that I find interesting enough to write about.

I am currently working as a data scientist at Zalando in Berlin. My interests include among other things sequential machine learning, revenue optimizing pricing algorithms and more recently Bayesian modeling.

I find myself often flirting with Tensor flow framework, and hope to write
something on that as well.
